    "## 3D Brain Segmentation Using 2D Fully Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of our experiments is to perform the brain extraction, also known as skull-stripping, using a 2D U-Shape fully convolutional neural network (CNN), which we chose the U-NET architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../figures/WorkflowRepPaper_2r.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used is the CC-359 which  consists of T1 volumes acquired in 359 subjects on scanners from three different vendors (GE, Philips, and Siemens) and at two magnetic field strengths (1.5 T and 3 T). The dataset has twelve volumes with manual segmentations that will be used to evaluate the proposed method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we basically use python to code and ITK-SNAP to see the 3D volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Keras\n",
